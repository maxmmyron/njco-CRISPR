# Getting Started with multi-react-template  

multi-react-template was bodged together by [mmyron](https://github.com/maxmmyron).

multi-react-template is a small template bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that includes both [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) and [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/) for quickly prototyping modern, dynamic, and scalable webpages and web applications.


## Installation

To install, simply type `npx create-react-app <project_name> --template multi-react-template`.
That's it! CRA will take care of the rest.
